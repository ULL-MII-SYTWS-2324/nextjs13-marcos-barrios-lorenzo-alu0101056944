# What I learned in lesson-5

 - There are self hosted fonts like Rubik, which is an object with a `className` property that can be assigned to any tag in the project.

 - The imported .css module is global because it was imported on the root layout so it is applied to all the child pages and layouts. In other words, .css imports have local scope.

 - Tailwind is a CSS Framework that defines hundreds of classes that are used like inline styles.

 - A `public/` folder can be used for static assets like images or they can also be inside the same folder of the file that will use it.

 - There is an Image component that has a `quality` attribute, whose 100 value means 100% quality and a `placeholder` attribute for choosing what to show while it is loading.
